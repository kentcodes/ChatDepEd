## My React App

This repository includes a React application located in `my-reactapp-chatdeped`.

### Setup

The app was created manually due to network restrictions. Dependencies are listed in `package.json` but are not installed.

1. Navigate to `my-reactapp-chatdeped`.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. (Requires internet access.)
3. Use `npm start` to run the development server.

Note: Running `npm test` will fail until all dependencies, including `react-scripts`, are installed.

The app contains skeleton components for phases outlined in the project description, including authentication, dashboard, data repository, and administrative reports.
